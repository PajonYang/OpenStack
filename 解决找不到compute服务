Start by checking nova-compute.log on the compute node. The error message in your screenshot is cut off so I can't see the full message, 
but it looks like nova-compute is unable to connect to RabbitMQ. You might want to check rabbitmq logs also.

why the compute node cannot talk to my controller node and rabbitmq server?

transpot_url = rabbit://openstack:RABBIT_PASS@controller


Check rabbitmq connection in nova-compute host telnet, config options, errors in nova-compute.log

Typical scenarios: No time synchronization between controller and compute node, or wrong message queue credentials 
configured, or no network connection (e.g. firewall).

Solved this problem by finding that my compute node did not install the correct nova-compute version. 
I find no such file "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudarchive-kilo.list". So I missed this step when installing compute node. 
So I reinstall the nova-compute by specifying the correct package and finally it works.
(check out the official installation guide: http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/instal...).


After i moved 
[oslo_messaging_rabbit]
rabbit_host = controller 
rabbit_userid = openstack
rabbit_password = RABBIT_PASS
to [DEFAULT] section, i got |5| nova-compute status "enabled" state "Up" but, later it changed state to "down".
